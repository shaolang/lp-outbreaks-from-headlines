Completed exercises to Manning's Live Project [Discovering Disease Outbreaks
from News Headlines][lp].

Instead of using the recommended packages, I used the following:

1. [Cartopy][cartopy]: 'cos [Basemap][basemap] is deprecated and even
   recommends Cartopy
2. [text-unidecode][text-unidecode]: 'cos [unidecode][unidecode] is GPL

## Running in non-Anaconda environment

There are at least two ways to do this:

1. Use [WinPython][winpython] instead
2. Download some of the dependencies from
  [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages][unofficial]

_And don't ask me why I'm so reluctant to installing Anaconda._
